# 2D Terrain Generator

This is some simple source code for a 2D terrain generator based on the
random midpoint displacement algorithm. I've used Java for the sake of
portability, although even I recognize that I would have prefer to do
this in C or C++ using probably SDL or pure OpenGL if possible (or, if
I better knew how to use it).

This source code has three packages.
* fractal, contains main fractal logic code.
* fractal.java2d, renders terrains using Java2D API (AWT, Swing...)
* fractal.slick2d, renders terrains using Slick2D/LWJGL API.

For now, Slick2D is the more advanced interface. I'm considering adding all
the interactive features that Slick2D version has such as tweaking in the
Java2D version. If you don't have installed Slick2D you can just ignore or
delete slick2d package and use Java2D version. It works the same.

I made public this source code for educational reasons, in the hope that
it helps to study such algorithms like this and it helps anybody wanting
to learn how to randomly generate terrains. Also, I published this source
code because otherwise it will rot by just leaving it on my computer.
